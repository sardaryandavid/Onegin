     Few foreign masterpieces can have suffered more than Eugene Onegin from
the English  translator's failure to convey anything more than -- at best --
the literal meaning.  It is  as if  a  sound-proof wall separated  Pushkin's
poetic novel from the English-reading world.  There  is  a whole magic which
goes by default: the  touching lyrical  beauty, the cynical wit of the poem;
the  psychological  insight,  the  devious  narrative  skill, the thrilling,
compulsive  grip of the novel; the tremendous gusto and swing and panache of
the whole performance.
     Vladimir Nabokov's rendering into unrhymed iambics reproduces the exact
meaning, but explicitly disclaims any further ambition. While Nabokov admits
that  in  losing  its  rhyme   the  work  loses  its  ``bloom''  he  argues,
irrefutably,  that  no rhyming  version  can  be literally  accurate. It can

Translator's note
     Few foreign masterpieces can have suffered more than Eugene Onegin from
the English  translator's failure to convey anything more than -- at best --
the literal meaning.  It is  as if  a  sound-proof wall separated  Pushkin's
poetic novel from the English-reading world.  There  is  a whole magic which
goes by default: the  touching lyrical  beauty, the cynical wit of the poem;
the  psychological  insight,  the  devious  narrative  skill, the thrilling,
compulsive  grip of the novel; the tremendous gusto and swing and panache of
the whole performance.
     Vladimir Nabokov's rendering into unrhymed iambics reproduces the exact
meaning, but explicitly disclaims any further ambition. While Nabokov admits
that  in  losing  its  rhyme   the  work  loses  its  ``bloom''  he  argues,
irrefutably,  that  no rhyming  version  can  be literally  accurate. It can
however certainly strive  for something else. It can attempt to produce some
substitute for  the ``bloom'' of  the original, without  which the  work  is
completely  dead.  It  can try to convey the poet's tone  of voice,  whether
world-weary  or romantic, the sparkle  of  his jokes,  the  flavour  of  his
epigrams, the snap of his  final couplets. None of these effects can  emerge
from  a  purely  literal  unrhymed  translation.  In  fact,  to  offset  the
inevitable  loss in verbal  exactness,  a  rhyming  version  can  aim  at  a
different sort of accuracy, an equivalence or parallelism conveying, however
faintly, the impact of the original.
     Apart from the overall  difficulty of  his  task, the  translator  with
ambitions of this  type will find  that Pushkin's work presents him with two
particular problems.
     The brio of the Russian text partly depends on a lavish use not only of
French and other foreign words, but of  slang and of  audacious Byronic-type
rhymes.  If  the  translator produces nothing comparable, he is emasculating
his original. If he attempts to follow suit, he must  do all he can to avoid
the pitfalls of the embarrassing, the facetious and the arch. {29}
     Secondly, he must be on his guard against the ludicrous effect that the
feminine  ending (for instance the pleasure/measure rhyme, which is so  much
derided by Nabokov) can all too easily produce in English. He must not sing,
like Prince Gremin in one English version of Chaykovsky's opera:
        ``I wouldn't be remotely human
        Did I not love the Little Woman.''
     (The libretto of the opera, which was  written and first performed more
than  forty  years  after  Pushkin's  death,  is by  Chaykovsky  himself and
Konstantin Shilovsky, a minor  poet of the time.  It  is  nominally based on
Pushkin's text, but in fact the relationship is not very close.)
     Anyway, it should  be possible now, with  the help of Nabokov's literal
translation and commentary, to produce a reasonably accurate rhyming version
of  Pushkin's  work  which   can  at  least  be   read  with   pleasure  and
entertainment, and which,  ideally,  might even be able to stand on  its own
feet as English. That, in all humility, is the aim of the present text.

          To Peter Alexandrovich Pletnev
     Heedless of the proud world's enjoyment,
     I prize the attention of my friends,
     and only wish that my employment
     could have been turned to worthier ends --
     worthier of you in the perfection
     your soul displays, in holy dreams,
     in simple but sublime reflection,
     in limpid verse that lives and gleams.
     But, as it is, this pied collection
     begs your indulgence -- it's been spun
     from threads both sad and humoristic,
     themes popular or idealistic,
     products of carefree hours, of fun,
     of sleeplessness, faint inspirations,
     of powers unripe, or on the wane,
     of reason's icy intimations,
     and records of a heart in pain.
Chapter One
          To live, it hurries, and to feel it hastes.
           Prince Vyazemsky
     ``My uncle -- high ideals inspire him;
     but when past joking he fell sick,
     he really forced one to admire him --
     and never played a shrewder trick.
     Let others learn from his example!
     But God, how deadly dull to sample
     sickroom attendance night and day
     and never stir a foot away!
     And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
     of entertaining the half-dead:
     one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
     and glumly serves the medicine bottle,
     and sighs, and asks oneself all through:
     "When will the devil come for you?"''
     Such were a young rake's meditations --
     by will of Zeus, the high and just,
     the legatee of his relations --
     as horses whirled him through the dust.
     Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila,
     without preliminary feeler
     let me acquaint you on the nail
     with this the hero of my tale:
     Onegin, my good friend, was littered
     and bred upon the Neva's brink,
     where you were born as well, I think,
     reader, or where you've shone and glittered!
     There once I too strolled back and forth:
     but I'm allergic to the North...1
     After a fine career, his father
     had only debts on which to live.
     He gave three balls a year, and rather
     promptly had nothing left to give.
     Fate saved Evgeny from perdition:
     at first Madame gave him tuition,
     from her Monsieur took on the child.
     He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
     Monsieur l'Abbé, the mediocre,
     reluctant to exhaust the boy,
     treated his lessons as a ploy.
     No moralizing from this joker;
     a mild rebuke was his worst mark,
     and then a stroll in Letny Park.
     But when the hour of youthful passion
     struck for Evgeny, with its play
     of hope and gloom, romantic-fashion,
     it was goodbye, Monsieur.
     Eugene was free, and as a dresser
     made London's dandy his professor.
     His hair was fashionably curled,
     and now at last he saw the World.
     In French Onegin had perfected
     proficiency to speak and write,
     in the mazurka he was light,
     his bow was wholly unaffected.
     The World found this enough to treat
     Eugene as clever, and quite sweet.
     We all meandered through our schooling
     haphazard; so, to God be thanks,
     it's easy, without too much fooling,
     to pass for cultured in our ranks.
     Onegin was assessed by many
     (critical judges, strict as any)
     as well-read, though of pedant cast.
     Unforced, as conversation passed,
     he had the talent of saluting
     felicitously every theme,
     of listening like a judge-supreme
     while serious topics were disputing,
     or, with an epigram-surprise,
     of kindling smiles in ladies' eyes.
     Now Latin's gone quite out of favour;
     yet, truthfully and not in chaff,
     Onegin knew enough to savour
     the meaning of an epigraph,
     make Juvenal his text, or better
     add vale when he signed a letter;
     stumblingly call to mind he did
     two verses of the Aeneid.
     He lacked the slightest predilection
     for raking up historic dust
     or stirring annalistic must;
     but groomed an anecdote-collection
     that stretched from Romulus in his prime
     across the years to our own time.
     He was without that dithyrambic
     frenzy which wrecks our lives for sound,
     and telling trochee from iambic
     was quite beyond his wit, we found.
     He cursed Theocritus and Homer,
     in Adam Smith was his diploma;
     our deep economist had got
     the gift of recognizing what
     a nation's wealth is, what augments it,
     and how a country lives, and why
     it needs no gold if a supply
     of simple product supplements it.
     His father failed to understand
     and took a mortgage on his land.
     Evgeny's total store of knowledge
     I have no leisure to recall;
     where he was master of his college,
     the art he'd studied best of all,
     his young heyday's supreme employment,
     its work, its torture, its enjoyment,
     what occupied his chafing powers
     throughout the boredom of the hours --
     this was the science of that passion
     which Ovid sang, for which the bard,
     condemned to a lifetime of hard,
     ended his wild career of fashion
     deep in Moldavia the abhorred,
     far, far from Italy, his adored.
     How early he'd learnt to dissemble,
     to hide a hope, to make a show
     of jealousy, to seem to tremble
     or pine, persuade of yes or no,
     and act the humble or imperious,
     the indifferent, or the deadly serious!
     In languid silence, or the flame
     of eloquence, and just the same
